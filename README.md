# Veggie Box

Veggie Box is a meal subscription service designed to make healthy eating easy and convenient. We offer a variety of 31 menu options for you to choose from and build your own VeggieBox. Once you've made your selection, we take care of the rest! We send you all the necessary ingredients along with step-by-step cooking instructions. Veggie Box is not just about providing meals, but also about saving you precious time and helping you make healthier choices. The application for this service is primarily written in JavaScript (90.5%), with styles in SCSS (8.7%), and some HTML (0.8%).

## How VeggieBox Works

**Step 1**: From our list of 31 menus, you can choose the ones you like the most and create your VeggieBox. We take care of the rest! Everything so that you only have to worry about cooking.

**Step 2**: We send you everything! All the necessary ingredients, spices... everything, along with the nutritional value and calories, suggested step-by-step instructions, videos... Everything!

**Step 3**: You've chosen the healthiest option! And now you have more time for yourself. You've saved 2 hours of supermarket shopping, 30 minutes of searching for options, and 40 minutes of waiting in lines. Enjoy üòÅ!
